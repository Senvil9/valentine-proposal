# How to Deploy Your Valentine's Website

To send this to someone, you need to host it on the web. Here are the two easiest ways:

## Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest & Fastest)
*Best for: Getting it online in 30 seconds.*

1.  **Locate your folder**: Open your file explorer to the folder containing your website files `c:\Users\LENOVO\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\valentine-proposal`.
2.  **Go to Netlify**: Open [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) in your web browser.
3.  **Drag and Drop**: Drag your entire `valentine-proposal` folder onto the area that says "Drag and drop your site folder here".
4.  **Done!**: Netlify will give you a link (e.g., `random-name-1234.netlify.app`).
5.  **Rename (Optional)**: If you sign up for a free account, you can change the site name to something like `for-my-valentine.netlify.app`.

## Option 2: GitHub Pages
*Best for: Updates and if you already use GitHub.*

1.  Create a new public repository on GitHub.
2.  Push your code to that repository.
3.  Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
4.  Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch** and choose `main`.
5.  Wait a minute, and GitHub will verify your link!
